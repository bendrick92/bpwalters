## Background

As an big fan of the British Top Gear, I found myself doing A LOT of Google searches to find specific episodes. While the Amazon/Netflix descriptions were pretty helpful, they didn't provide much context on what cars were featured or what challenges/specials were in each episode.

I had been doing a lot of work learning how to build RESTful API's with a friend at the time, so I decided this would be a great opportunity to practice myself.

The resulting API and corresponding website utilize detailed episode descriptions from Wikipedia to provide real-time matching and recommendations based on user input. I had used Google's auto-complete search suggestions as inspiration. While it could certainly be improved, I'm very happy with the result.

I currently have no plans to enhance or add additional functionality to this site.

## Objectives

* Build a RESTful Rails API
* Get more experience with Backbone.js
* Replicate Google's auto-complete
