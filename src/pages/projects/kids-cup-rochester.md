## Background

The Kid's Cup Rochester is a charity event benefiting children at Mayo Clinic Childrenâ€™s Center and Olmsted Medical Center.

I was approached to help update the website and create a more self-manageable website. The desire was to be able to quickly and easily update dates, text, images, sponsors, etc.

Leveraging Jekyll as a static site generator, an integration with Siteleaf provides a basic CMS for the admins.

In addition, leveraging Github pages for hosting means the overhead cost of maintaining the site is kept to a minimum (essentially just the annual domain registration)!

## Objectives

* Provide an intuitive CMS for basic site management
* Minimize costs
